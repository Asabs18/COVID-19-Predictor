<p style="padding-left: 25%; padding-right: 25%; padding-bottom: 5%; color: black;">
    This site showcases a small and simple prediction algorithm used to try and predict future COVID-19 cases in our community. Who are we? We are a group of students
    going to Haldane Highschool in Coldspring, NY. We created this project in our computer science class from around March - April of 2021. The intent of this project
    was mainly educational so none of the graphs or predictions on this site should be taken as fact or reliable source.

<h3 style="padding-left: 43%; color: black;">Whats Under the Hood?</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 25%; padding-right: 25%; padding-bottom: 5%; color: black;">
    This project collects data from https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/index.htm, parses that data and passes the relevant infromation through a Recurrent Neural Network,
    More specifically a Long-Short-Term-Memory model to try and predict future COVID-19 cases in our county. That prediction along with the original data is then passed
    to this website where it is displayed in a quick easy to understand format. This entire project automatically updates to show the most recent data whenever possible.
